a - The difference between stat(1) and stat(3) is that stat(1) has been developed to used from the command line. On the otherhand, stat(3) allows the file status information to be gathered by programmers in a piece of software. Stat(1) actually makes use of stat(3) in order to return information about the user-specified file.
b - This piece of software will, given a filename, return the file type and mode of the file.

a - This piece of code will iterate through  and print out each file that is referenced in the current directory.

a - du makes use of the depth first search tree traversal algorithm.
b - The default block size used by du is 1024 bytes.
c - Since the harddisk is typically broken down into blocks of a specified size it makes sense to report the amount of memory a file takes up in block form. If it was reported as bytes, then the value would need to be converted to determine how many blocks of physical memory to use.
